			<h2 id="about-me-header">About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a mathematician in the process of transitioning to software engineering.</p>

		<p>After finishing up my PhD in mathematics in New York, I took various teaching gigs until I became a curriculum designer at an educational technology company in the Bay Area, where I realized that I wanted to become a software engineer. Since leaving my previous job, I have been working everyday to improve my CS knowledge and coding skills. My main focus is getting the Full Stack Developer Certification from freeCodeCamp.</p>
	 <p>Over the next few years, I hope to grow as a software engineer and work on challenging, impactful projects that can make peopleâ€™s lives better.</p>

			<h2 id="skills-header">My Skills</h2>
		<p>Python is the language I have known the longest, and I am most familiar with. I love Jupyter Notebook!</p>

<p>I am currently learning JavaScript, Html, and CSS through freeCodeCamp. I got my JavaScript certification from freeCodeCamp the day after I had my very first onsite interview :D</p>

<p>I am somewhat familiar with Java, but I will need a few weeks to review it before I can work with it.</p>
